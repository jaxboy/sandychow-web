                <h2>CCSF: Connect To Your Future</h2>
                    <p>City College of San Francisco is a community college that offers an affordable opportunity to earn associate degrees, transfer program, and pursue career and technical education.</p>
              
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>CCSF had big plans for the future to help improve their education programs even extravantly adding new buildings to the small campus on the hill. However, on July 2013, the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges threatened to shut down the school and remove accreditation because of tangled governance structures, poor fiscal controls and insufficient self-evaluation and reporting. The school remained opened for the next 4 years as they battled legally to revoke their accreditation. After the accreditation crisis in 2012, CCSF was having low student enrollment issues. </p>
              
                <h2>Design Approach and Concept</h2>
                    <p>I collaborated with another design student in our design studio praciticum course. We were quick to develop a strategy and concept for our CCSF Schedule Cover and our ideas were very much aligned and straightforward. Our instructors encouraged the idea of using photos of teachers and students performing class activities. I quickly came up with the slogan "Connect to Your Future" and my partner bounced that idea and came up with the subway paths to indicate the idea of connected pathways in relation to students choosen a path within their major and studies.</p>
                
                    <p>We both knew we had something great and meaningful in our concept and it didn't take us long to come up with this idea. We collaborated very well and kept the idea very simple and straightforward.</p>
                        
                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                   <p>Not only was our client the Chancellor of CCSF, but this was one of the most important projects in the course because it's published and massly distributed to the residents in San Francisco. Not only were we presenting to the client, we were also competing with 10 other groups in the class. We sat in the waiting room as the client and our instructors reviewed our presentation. We were all very nervous and we all wanted to be selected.</p>
              
                <h2>Result</h2>
                   <p>The door opened and we hear our names called to next room. We were the lucky ones to be selected from the bunch. Our client told us that our Schedule Cover was perfectly aligned with his vision and exactly what he was looking for.</p>
