                <h2>Mark Bittman: How to Cook Everything</h2>
                    <p>Mark Bittman is the author of more than 20 books. How to Cook Everything Series was one of his best-selling and award-winning book, several of which are also successful apps. He is a New York Times novelist and writer and produced The Minimalist, along with hundreds of food and travel stories and videos. He devotes most of his gtime to cookbooks, teaching and developing strategies to guarantee food is fair, affordable, nutritious, green, and delicious.</p>
            
              
            <h2>The Objective</h2>
                <p>To create a modern and up-to-date modern app feature and content</p>
             
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>The mobile app is very old and outdated because most of the features such as buttons, colors, styles, etc. looked quite obsolete in this day in age of technology. His app reminded me of the old cookbooks that was text-based with no images of the finished product. His app did not have any images to represent the final product which made.</p>
                
                <div class="portfolio-single-content">
                    <div class="col-md-12 margin-top">
                        <div class="row">
                            <img src="assets/images/htce/htce-1.png" alt="Project Image"/></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
            </div>

                <p>The app reminds me of the First Generation of iPhone when it first came out with the dropshadows and the way the buttons are styled. The technology has came along way from looking busy and crowded to clean, simple, and minimal designs. The red color is too jarring to look at and it seems like that's getting the most attention and its hard to focus on the important content and features in the app.</p>
              
            <h2>The Solutions</h2>
                <p>Although the homepage seemed pretty convenient to browse the recipes, Bittman's Picks, Popular Dishes, Quick Dinners and etc, there's even a better way to treat the design to make it more aesthetically pleasing to eye and still include all the above.</p>
                
                <p>I took main topics people look for which were the few things she listed on the app's homepage. Today's technology is all about simplistic and minimalist structure as well as conveniency for the users so users won't have to click too much. I made it much simplier and convenient for the user to browse the recipes within their prospective cateogies such as Featured Recipes, Popular Dishes, Bittman's Picks, and Quick Dinner just simple by scrolling the page. To view more option for Featured Recipes or Bittman's Picks, the user can just simply click on the text and it will brig them to a whole new page. To make it easier for them, I also created a filter where they can pick their own cooking time, type of food using 1 or multiple tags, popular food category and courses. 
                </p>
                
                <p>The user chooses a category such as Bittman Picks and chooses to cook Carnitas Taco which then leads them to a new page. In this page, I added an image to the page with rotating images that includes a broken down Ingredients Panel and directions. The design treatment of the Ingredients Panel with the orange and gray bullet points helps user indicate what ingredients they have and don't have that they need to buy and create their own shopping to-do-list before they cook. As for the Directions Panel, I use a similar design treatment. As the user scrolls down the page, the cooking instructions will fade and become gray while the current cooking instruction will turn orange. This helps keeps the user's eyes focused on the current cookding step and eliminate the unwanted distraction so the user can focus on the current one.
